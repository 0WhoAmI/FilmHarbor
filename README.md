## Database Description
### One-to-Many Relationship between Users and Favorite Movies:
- **Users** table has a primary key `UserId`.
- **FavoriteMovies** table has two foreign keys, `UserId` and `MovieId`, both referencing the `UserId` in the **Users** table and `MovieId` in the **Movies** table, respectively.
- This implies that one user can have multiple favorite movies, forming a one-to-many relationship.

### One-to-Many Relationship between Movies and Categories:
- **Movies** table has a primary key `MovieId`.
- **Categories** table has a foreign key `CategoryId` referencing the `CategoryId` in the **Movies** table.
- This implies that one movie can belong to a single category, forming a one-to-many relationship.

### One-to-Many Relationship between Movies and Reviews:
- **Movies** table has a primary key `MovieId`.
- **Reviews** table has two foreign keys, `MovieId` and `UserId`, both referencing the `MovieId` in the **Movies** table and `UserId` in the **Users** table, respectively.
